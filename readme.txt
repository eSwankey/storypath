Some notes:
- I have not been able to implement the API for storing the username and profile picture
- I acknowledge that I have used online resources and GenAI in creating some of my code, they have been listed below:
- There is some functionality that does not work but is still in the code. I have added comments to indicate these sections.
- Due to using typescript there are some errors that show up for type checking that do not break the pages

I used GenAI for furthering my understanding of the file structure and how the react router ties everthing together. 
I have also used it for easier implementations of the styling for App.tsx and ProjectOverviewScreen.tsx

Thank you
